# Housing-price-prediction Using Machine Learning

**Project Description:**

The "Housing Price Prediction" project aims to build a machine learning model that can accurately estimate the price of residential properties based on various features such as location, area, number of rooms, and amenities. Accurate housing price prediction is crucial for real estate investors, developers, and buyers to make informed decisions.

The dataset used includes details of various housing properties. Data preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and normalization are applied to prepare the dataset. Feature selection techniques are employed to improve model performance and reduce overfitting.

**Key Components:**

* **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing:** Handling null values, outliers, and converting categorical variables into numeric format.
* **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Visualizing trends and correlations between features and the target variable.
* **Model Building:** Implementing regression models like Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and Random Forest Regressor.
* **Model Evaluation:** Assessing performance using metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and RÂ² score.

**Outcome:**
The model can predict housing prices with a high degree of accuracy, making it a useful tool for property valuation and market analysis.
